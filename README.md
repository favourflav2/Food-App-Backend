# Order Food App
- [Order Food App](https://food-app-frontend-cbb2.onrender.com/)
This is a Full-Stack Food Ordering App using React for the frontend and Nodejs for the backend. A user can order food and make a payment using stripe.


# Description
My goal with this application was to showcase my use of tailwind and my ability to save data to my database. While providing a user with a great UI. I didn't come up with the design and or project I used https://direct.chownow.com/order/195/locations/260?order_item_id=1698c5a7-8c02-4461-83b2-c7cbdfb2bcc7 as inspiration.


My backend was also pretty easy, the only thing different was the incorporation of Stripe. I used Express Router to handle all my requests to my database and frontend. Instead of just copying and pasting the data, I just made routes that inserted my data into my database. From there all I had to do was integrate Stripe and my backend was pretty much done.


My frontend and backend are both deployed on Render for free so the first initial call to my backend may take some time. And my database is hosted on CockroachDB.
